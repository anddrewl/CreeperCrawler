8. Upon their demise, any enemy that is not a dragon, human, or merchant will drop either a small pile or normal pile of gold
(discussed below). This gold is immediately added to the player characterâ€™s total.
9. verify enemies are moved line by line

changes:
-- add a new field cellSymbol to the player.h to track the cell symbol as we need reset back this symbol after moving away from the current cell.
-- run into circular dependency on Enemy and Player classes
-- first spawnTreasure and generate Dragon to guard to avoid situation all 8 cells are occupied by character or enemies.
-- do not move Dragon
